# Introduction to Armur Code Scanner

This is the official repository for the Armur static code scanner, built with Go. It uses the best open-source static analysis tools, combining them into a seamless pipeline for identifying security vulnerabilities and code quality issues. This tool is designed to be efficient and effective, particularly for languages like Go, Python, and JavaScript.

### Running Locally (Development)

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Armur-Ai/Armur-Code-Scanner.git
cd Armur-Code-Scanner
```

2.  **Start the Development Environment:**

First copy/rename `.env.example` file to `.env` and run the following commands

```bash
make docker-up
```

OR

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This command does the following:

- Builds the application image based on `Dockerfile`.
- Starts the application and Redis containers in development mode using `docker-compose.yml`.
- Generates the swagger documentation
- After running this, the application will be available at `http://localhost:4500`.
- Swagger documentation will be available here `http://localhost:4500/swagger/index.html`
